							<h2>Offers Much Wonder <p></p>and a Little Bit of Strange</h2>
							<p>One Strange Rock Documentary</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Seeing the Earth from the vacuum of space makes it clear that the world is not just its living and breathing natural parts. There is also a whole lot of rock (and water, clouds, and other inorganic substances). That makes One Strange Rock one part natural history, one part Earth science — and one part “floating in a most peculiar way,” as Hadfield sang that time in space. </p>
							<p>We also learn about the chemical processes that keep our bodies running. In one segment, Hadfield talks about how precious oxygen is for our bodies — by describing his experience with hypoxia, or lack of oxygen. <p>Too little oxygen is bad, but so is too much oxygen. Three hundred million years ago, the oxygen level in the Earth’s atmosphere was much, much higher, “so much that the planet just burned,” says Smith. The same would be true today.</p>

								But fortunately for us, since then the oxygen levels have been “surprisingly constant,” says Hadfield, making up 20.95 percent of our atmosphere. This highlights a key fact about the Earth —balance. But our world is not just balance. Everything on the planet is also remarkably intertwined.</p>

								<h3>Circle of Life</h3>
								<p>Bats eat fruit and spread the seeds in their droppings. The Earth tilts just the right amount for us to have winter and summer toward the polar regions. A butterfly flaps it wings in the rainforest and a bird eats it, and so on.

									For Buddhists, this is interdependence at its finest. Everything depends upon everything else. It’s this kind of mutual arising that allows us, and all other life forms, to continue to live on the Earth.</p>

								<h3>One Strange Rock Documentary</h3>
								<p>With 10 episodes to travel along with, there’s a lot of nature and geology and other -ologies to experience in One Strange Rock. Whether or not you find that itlives up to its name — or if it’s just One Rock — will depend upon your previous exposure to other strangeness on the big and small screens. And, of course, your ability to “geek out” on all things science.<p></p>

									But even if the documentary doesn’t appear all that strange to you, it’s still worth watching. Strange or not, our planet — whether it’s called One Strange Rock or Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot — is still amazing. There’s no denying that, even when viewed from the comfort of our plush recliner chairs.</p>
